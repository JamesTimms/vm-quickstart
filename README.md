# VM Quickstart
A collection of bash scripts for small customisation and configuration items on Linux VMs. Mostly used in GCP but might have some scripts for AWS and other cloud envrionments in the future.

## Usage
Used for personal projects and a dumping ground for random scripts. Run scripts by typing `./[script_name]` on Linux shells.

## Requirements
A relatively modern linux Shell.

## TODO
- Auto discover the latest version of gcloud and install that by default.
